# Problem 6: Double Trouble
# Help Winnie the Pooh double his honey! Write a function doubled() that accepts a list of integers hunny_jars as a parameter and
# multiplies each element in the list by two. Return the doubled list.
#
# def doubled(hunny_jars):
#     pass
#
# Example Usage:
#
# hunny_jars = [1, 2, 3]
# print(doubled(hunny_jars))
#
# Example Output:
#
# [2, 4, 6]


def doubled(hunny_jars):
    hunny_two = []
    for num in hunny_jars:
        hunny_two.append(num * 2)
    return hunny_two
